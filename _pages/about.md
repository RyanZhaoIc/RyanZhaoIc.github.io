**Bio:** I am currently a Ph.D. student at Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJTU), under the supervision of Associate Professor Shi Bin. I obtained my M.s. and B.s. degrees from Xi’an Jiaotong University and Xiamen University of Technology, respectively. My primary research interests lie in the field of weakly supervised learning, including label noise learning and partial label learning.
